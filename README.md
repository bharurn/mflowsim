# mflowsim
This code can simulate microfluidic pipe flow and calculate the heat transfer coefficient between the surfaces through which flow occurs. The input parameters are to be given in the file 'input.in' as shown in the example. The file outputs the heat transfer coefficient as well as the velocity and temperature profiles.
